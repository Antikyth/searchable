# Searchable
_Makes Minecraft more searchable!_

Improves the search functionality of the singleplayer world selection screen
and also brings it to:
- the multiplayer server selection screen
- the languages screen
- the key binds screen
- the edit game rules screen during world creation

Please suggest any Minecraft screens that could also do with search functionality,
or any other suggestions you have, in the issues tab :)
